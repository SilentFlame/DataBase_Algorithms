# DataBase_Algorithms
Some python Implementations of Database Systems Algorithms.

- Undo, Redo and Undo-Redo logging Algorithms

### Content ###
##### Code #####
- This directory contains the python codes of 1,2,3,4,... quantum number undo, redo and undo-redo.
- The directory structure is like 1.py, 2.py, .... etc

##### Logs #####
- Contains the logs of the undo, redo and undo-redo python scripts mentioned above.
- files are named like `1.txt_undo`: undo log of `1.py` file, `1.txt_redo`: redo file of 1.py, and so on.


--------------------

### To run the codes ###
- First make sure that you have a `logs directory` along with your `code directory`.
- `$python 1.py`: to run the quantum number 1 file.
- change values in the name of the files [1 to 9] and see the output logs.
